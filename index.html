    <h1>Project Team 23: Public Transportation Systems Efficiency Analysis, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Aaron Gold</strong>, <strong>Jimmy Kong</strong>, <strong>Abbie Murphy</strong>, <strong>Emily Szabo </strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em></em></p>
    
    <p><em>The primary motivation for selecting this research topic is to discover patterns and trends in public transportation spending efficiency.
       While there are several potential uses for the visualizations generated, discovering new hypotheses and trends is the foremost reason. 
       This is because discovery “is about the generation and verification of hypotheses, associated with modes of scientific inquiry” (Brehmer, 2013). 
       The goal is for governments that want to improve their public transportation systems to use the trends from these visualizations to better allocate
        their resources and improve the quality of their systems. We plan to address these needs by making it clear what aspects of various systems are
         successful, essentially handing them a blueprint from which to improve their own designs. </em></p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        Explore the interactive graphs by engaging with the scatterplot points or brushing over them to select one or more countries. The side bar charts will dynamically update to display data for the selected countries. Similarly, selections made on the side bar charts will synchronize with the scatterplot.
      </p>
      <p>The visualizations are divided into three categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Financial Measures</strong>: Display rail passengers per capita and rail investment for each country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quality Measures</strong>: Show quality rankings and rail density for each country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access Measures</strong>: Highlight the percentage of the population with access to public transportation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hover over countries to view detailed information. Clicking on a country will reveal a pair of percentage bars showing the ratio of infrastructure spending on maintenance and infrastructure spending on rail. If data for a metric isn’t available, only the relevant percentage bar will appear.
      </p>
      <p>To reset your selections and explore anew, use the <strong>"Clear Selection"</strong> button.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em></em></p>

    <p><em>The domain tasks are the essential questions that drive the research and discovery in infrastructure investment analysis, such as understanding the correlations between spending and efficiency. Initially, our domain tasks included a range of questions, including cost of transport and  the geographical extent of  system coverage. However, as we narrowed our focus, these became less critical. Ultimately,  the most important domain task we outlined was the correlation between annual investment and the efficiency of public transportation. 

      <br>At the lowest level, analytic tasks such as Correlate, Find Externum, and Retrieve Values are defined by the user’s ability to identify data for individual countries and compare the differences between many countries (Amar, Eagan, & Stasko, 2004). This aligns with Schneiderman’s Information-Seeking Mantra, which  emphasizes the importance of starting with an overview and zooming in on the details(Schneiderman, 1996). Together these tasks enable the users to examine the data as a whole, as well as the individual information for each country. 
      
      <br>The mid-level search tasks include Browse, Locate, and Explore. These tasks focus on identifying relevant data points and uncovering patterns within the dataset. In our visualization, browse and locate are expected to be more frequently utilized, as most users will be searching the data without a specific target. 
      
      <br>Finally, the highest level tasks include Discover and Present, and these focus on how the visualization is being used. These tasks enable the users to to consume and discover new knowledge and uncover patterns. Our visualization's primary goal is for users to utilize these tasks to gain insight into infrastructure investment across different countries. 
      </em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
