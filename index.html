    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em></em></p>
    
    <p><em>The primary motivation for selecting this research topic is to discover patterns and trends in public transportation spending efficiency.
       While there are several potential uses for the visualizations generated, discovering new hypotheses and trends is the foremost reason. 
       This is because discovery “is about the generation and verification of hypotheses, associated with modes of scientific inquiry” (Brehmer, 2013). 
       The goal is for governments that want to improve their public transportation systems to use the trends from these visualizations to better allocate
        their resources and improve the quality of their systems. We plan to address these needs by making it clear what aspects of various systems are
         successful, essentially handing them a blueprint from which to improve their own designs. </em></p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        Explore the interactive graphs by engaging with the scatterplot points or brushing over them to select one or more countries. The side bar charts will dynamically update to display data for the selected countries. Similarly, selections made on the side bar charts will synchronize with the scatterplot.
      </p>
      <p>The visualizations are divided into three categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Financial Measures</strong>: Display rail passengers per capita and rail investment for each country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quality Measures</strong>: Show quality rankings and rail density for each country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access Measures</strong>: Highlight the percentage of the population with access to public transportation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hover over countries to view detailed information. Clicking on a country will reveal a pair of percentage bars showing the ratio of infrastructure spending on maintenance and infrastructure spending on rail. If data for a metric isn’t available, only the relevant percentage bar will appear.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>This visualization aims to determine if countries were spending money effectively on their rail systems. To begin, effective spending was measured by the usage of the system in 2022 after investment in rail infrastructure during 2021. Why spend money on something if it is not utilized by citizens of a country? </em></p>
    <p><em>For most countries, there seems to be a trend of spending more correlating to more usage. These can be considered to have effective spending since they are “getting out what they are putting in.” For example, Lithuania has one of the lower usages with only about 1.54 passengers per capita. However, Lithuania has one of the lowest investments, so they “get what they pay for.” Countries that fall out of this trend are considered to be spending ineffectively. Countries included in the outliers are Turkey, Australia, the USA, Germany, and France, which appear to be spending ineffectively. Turkey has approximately the same ridership as Lithuania with 1.62 passengers per capita but spends about 20x the amount on rail infrastructure. Similarly, the USA is spending more than 80x the amount of Lithuania but has even worse ridership with only 0.03 passengers per capita! In fact, the USA spends 2.36x the amount of our “most effective spender” Switzerland but has the worst ridership. </em></p>
    <p><em>Other outliers such as Germany and France perform well with usage; they fall in the top half of countries with usage, ranking fourth and fifth most usage respectively. They are still not deemed “effective spenders” as they are also the top two biggest spenders with the smallest rewards. Why do they have less ridership than Belgium while spending 10x (France) and 8x (Germany) the amount? Australia is an additional outlier, performing fourth worst in ridership but also spending the fourth most. </em></p>
    <p><em>After deciding which countries spend effectively on rail, we look at the breakdown of this spending. Do the “effective spenders” spend their money differently from “ineffective spenders?” First, does spending more on maintenance or other infrastructure correlate with more effective spending? Should countries like France and Turkey follow the ratio of Switzerland with 18.2% maintenance or other effective spenders? Note that for this measure, there is no data for the USA, Germany, and Australia. There appears to be no formula for spending vs maintenance. Within countries deemed “effective spenders,” there are large variations in ratios. Turkey (an outlier) has a similar ratio to effective spender the Slovak Republic, France (ineffective) is similar to Belgium and Austria (both effective). </em></p>
    <p><em>The next split is the percentage of total inland transport budget that goes to rail. Inland transportation includes rail, roads, waterways, and air infrastructure. This also showed little correlation, however the USA is notable with a significant proportion of total budget going to rail, lower than 8%. </em></p>
    <p><em>Finally, we look at some other factors that may affect usage. Quality appears to have the least correlation with usage and effective spending. The USA has the second highest quality but the lowest usage. However, Turkey, the USA, and Australia have the lowest density of rail and the lowest access to general public transportation. This matches with Lithuania's low spending as low on all quality and access measures: 5th lowest on quality, 5th lowest on density, and 4th lowest on access. However, Germany and France are also outliers but are high with access. Germany is ranked high on density whereas France is not as high. This indicates that skimping on density and access may have some impact on usage and effectiveness but not a deciding factor. Overall, these quality measures have light correlation with effectiveness and usage but are not concrete.</em></p>
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em></em></p>

    <p><em>The domain tasks are the essential questions that drive the research and discovery in infrastructure investment analysis, such as understanding the correlations between spending and efficiency. Initially, our domain tasks included a range of questions, including cost of transport and  the geographical extent of  system coverage. However, as we narrowed our focus, these became less critical. Ultimately,  the most important domain task we outlined was the correlation between annual investment and the efficiency of public transportation. 

      <br>At the lowest level, analytic tasks such as Correlate, Find Externum, and Retrieve Values are defined by the user’s ability to identify data for individual countries and compare the differences between many countries (Amar, Eagan, & Stasko, 2004). This aligns with Schneiderman’s Information-Seeking Mantra, which  emphasizes the importance of starting with an overview and zooming in on the details(Schneiderman, 1996). Together these tasks enable the users to examine the data as a whole, as well as the individual information for each country. 
      
      <br>The mid-level search tasks include Browse, Locate, and Explore. These tasks focus on identifying relevant data points and uncovering patterns within the dataset. In our visualization, browse and locate are expected to be more frequently utilized, as most users will be searching the data without a specific target. 
      
      <br>Finally, the highest level tasks include Discover and Present, and these focus on how the visualization is being used. These tasks enable the users to to consume and discover new knowledge and uncover patterns. Our visualization's primary goal is for users to utilize these tasks to gain insight into infrastructure investment across different countries. 
      </em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <!--<p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>-->

    <p><em>We adopted the ICE-T methodology—"Insight, Confidence, Essence, and Time"—to guide the design of various components (Amar, R.A., Eagan, J.R., & Stasko, J.T., pp. 3-4). This approach emphasizes the following:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Supporting both intentional and incidental insights through visualization.</em></li>
      <p><em>Our visualizations are designed to support both intentional and incidental insights. The scatterplot allows users to intentionally explore correlations between infrastructure investment and rail usage, while the bar charts provide incidental insights by highlighting differences in quality, access, and density across countries.</em></p>

      <li><em>Facilitating faster and more efficient understanding of data for searching and browsing.</em></li>
      <p><em>We facilitate faster and more efficient understanding of data by allowing users to interact with the scatterplot and bar charts. Users can brush over the scatterplot to select multiple countries or click on individual points to view detailed information. The bar charts dynamically update to reflect the selected countries, making it easy to search and compare for specific data points.</em></p>

      <li><em>Communicating the dataset's essence, focusing on overview and context.</em></li>
      <p><em>Our visualizations communicate the dataset's essence by providing an overview of key metrics such as infrastructure investment, rail usage, quality, access, and density. The scatterplot offers a high-level view of the data, while the bar charts provide context by breaking down the data into more specific categories.</em></p>

      <li><em>Enhancing user confidence in understanding the dataset by addressing the quality of the data and the visualization.</em></li>
      <p><em>We enhance user confidence by ensuring that our visualizations are clear and easy to understand with included sources. The use of tooltips and labels helps users interpret the data accurately. Additionally, we address the quality of the data by providing detailed hard number information about each data point, including maintenance, infrastructure investment, and population.</em></p>
    </ul>
