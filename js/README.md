# All Our Javascript Files
* `visualization.js` is the main code that builds all of our visualization and facilitates brushing and linking. Uses scatterplot, countyBar, countryBarGraphs, and inlandRail. 
* `scatterplot.js` contains the main scatterplot structure to compare infrastructure spending to rail usage. 
* `inlandRail.js` creates the popup bar when a point on the scatterplot is clicked, with percentages of inland transport spending that is dedicated to rail.
* `countryBar.js` creates another popup bar when a point on the scatterplot is clicked. It contains the percentage of rail investment goes to maintenence.
* `countryBarGraphs.js`is a template for the bar graphs next to the scatterplot. These show the rankings of each country for various measures.
* `imageCarousel.js` creates the image carousel in the prototypes section to show various sketches we made without taking up too much space. 
* `toggleGroups.js` an extra javascript file to be called when switching between groups of bar graphs depending on the type of data that you are trying to view. Essentially functionality for certain buttons.
